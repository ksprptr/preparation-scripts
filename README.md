## Purpose

This repository provides ready-to-use preparation scripts for different frameworks and environments.  
Scripts help automate initial setup tasks, including installing dependencies, configuring code standards, setting up hooks, cleaning up project structure, and more.

It is intended for developers who want to quickly bootstrap projects with best practices and consistent configuration.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant script/framework folder (e.g., `scripts/nextjs/bash`)
2. Follow the instructions in the framework-specific `README.md` for running the preparation script.

Alternatively, use the **proxy API** for direct download links:

- Example Bash: `https://scripts.ksprptr.dev/nextjs/bash`
- Example PowerShell: `https://scripts.ksprptr.dev/nextjs/ps`

> **⚠️ Warning:** Scripts modify and delete files in your project. Run them at your own risk. Always use a clean Git state or backup. Author is not responsible for any data loss.
